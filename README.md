# Speed Typer

This application lets you select the difficulty i.e, Easy, Medium & Hard for typing.

And how this works is each time you finish typing a word it adds few seconds to the clock based on the difficulty you selected. And it adds 1 to your score each time you finish a word.

Also when the clock runs out it will tell your score and gets you the Play Again button.
